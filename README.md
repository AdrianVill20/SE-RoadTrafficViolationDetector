# SE-RoadTrafficViolationDetector  

### Overview  
**SE-RoadTrafficViolationDetector** is an early-stage prototype that aims to detect traffic violations using artificial intelligence and real-time camera feeds. The system currently focuses on setting up the foundational environment, configuring dependencies, and initializing live object detection from a webcam.  

This stage serves as the groundwork for future development, where labeling and advanced classification (e.g., detecting cars, persons, or license plates) will be implemented next.

###  Project Description  
The project’s ultimate goal is to automate the monitoring of road activity by:  
- Capturing real-time footage from cameras  
- Detecting vehicles and other objects  
- Preparing for future violation identification such as overspeeding, lane violations, or illegal turns  
- Collecting time, date, and vehicle details for later storage and reporting  

Currently, the project is configured to **initialize and display real-time object detection using OpenCV and TensorFlow**.

###  Installation & Setup  

#### 1. Clone or Download the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SE-RoadTrafficViolationDetector.git
cd SE-RoadTrafficViolationDetector

```

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
It’s recommended to isolate dependencies using a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv tfenv
```

### 3. Activate the Environment
Windows (PowerShell):
```bash
tfenv\Scripts\activate
```
macOS/Linux:
```bash
source tfenv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries for TensorFlow and OpenCV.
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python
```
(Optional but recommended:)
Verify the installations:
```bash
python -c "import cv2; print('OpenCV', cv2.__version__)"
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print('TensorFlow', tf.__version__)"
```

## Running the Object Detection Script
Once dependencies are installed, run the demo file to start your camera stream:
```bash
python detect_demo.py
```
If successful, your webcam will open.<br>
The system currently detects general motion/objects.

---
## Optional Tests

### 1. Test Webcam Access
```bash
python webcam_test.py
```
If the window opens showing your camera feed, press Q to close it.

### 2. Test Basic Motion Detection
```bash
python motion_detector.py
```
This script should highlight moving objects in the camera feed.
