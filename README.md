# SE-RoadTrafficViolationDetector

This project aims to develop an automated system that detects traffic violations using artificial intelligence and camera technology. The system captures real-time images or videos of vehicles, identifies violations such as overspeeding or illegal lane use, and records relevant details like time, date, and license plate number. The collected data is stored in a database and can automatically notify traffic authorities for review and action. This system helps improve road safety, reduce manual monitoring, and promote disciplined driving behavior.
